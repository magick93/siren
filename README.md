## Documentation

The [Lighthouse Book](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io) contains information for users and
developers. Specifically the [Lighthouse UI](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/lighthouse-ui.html) section of the book.

## Running Siren

### Docker (Recommended)

Docker is the recommended way to run Siren. This will expose Siren as a webapp. 

Configuration is done through environemnt variables, the best way to get started is by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and editing the relevant sections (typically, this would at least include `BEACON_URL`, `VALIDATOR_URL` and `API_TOKEN`)

Then to run the image:

`docker compose up`
or  
`docker run --rm -ti --name siren -p 3443:443 --env-file $PWD/.env sigp/siren`  

This will open port 3443 and allow your browser to connect. 


To start Siren, visit `https://localhost:3443` in your web browser (ignore the certificate warning). 

Advanced users can mount their own certificate (the config expects 3 files: `/certs/cert.pem` `/certs/key.pem` `/certs/key.pass`)

## Building From Source

The docker image can be built with the following command:  
`docker build -f Dockerfile -t siren .`
